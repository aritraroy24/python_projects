## Note: :memo:
1. Basic ***```tkinter```*** module syntax has been used to make this software
2. Note that, it has been done mainly for ***```Run Out```*** reviews. But one can further modify it for other reviews also using similar method.
3. Furthermore, one can directly capture live video using ***```cv2```*** i.e. ***```opencv-python```*** module and take decision for a live game.
